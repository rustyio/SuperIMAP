# SuperIMAP - Version 0.1.1

SuperIMAP is an inbound mail processor. It triggers a webhook event to
your application when new email arrives in an IMAP inbox, typically
within seconds. SuperIMAP is especially useful for applications that
need to react to email in real-time on behalf of their users.

[FiveStreet.com](https://www.fivestreet.com) built SuperIMAP as an
alternative to Context.io. It contains a subset of Context.io Lite API
functionality. As of July 2015, the FiveStreet team runs a SuperIMAP
cluster processing ~400k emails per day for thousands of users.

The following IMAP authentication methods are supported:

+ Gmail OAuth 2.0
+ Plain authentication (username / password)

SuperIMAP is written in Ruby on Rails and is open source under the MIT
license.

## Security

If you use this code, *PLEASE* ensure that you use very strong,
safeguarded passwords, and preferably, make sure your entire database
is encrypted at rest. It is a big responsibility to hold the keys to
someone's email. Treat it with the appropriate amount of caution.

Other security measures:

+ SSL is *required* in production.
+ Secure fields (e.g. passwords and other credentials) are never exposed via the web interface, and are encrypted in the database.
+ Passwords are not recoverable by email.
+ Accounts are locked for an hour after three invalid password attempts.

## Data Model

SuperIMAP has:

* **IMAP Providers** - Configures an authentication transport
  mechanism. For example, there are connection types for "Plain" and "Gmail OAuth 2.0".
* **Partners** - Create a partner for each application / environment
  that will use SuperIMAP.
* **Partner Connection** - Defines a connection between a partner and
  a given IMAP Provider. Holds, for example, an application's OAuth
  keys.
* **Users** - Defines a user's credentials for a specific partner connection.

Users are uniquely identified by a combination of `imap_provider_code`
and `tag`. The tag is chosen by the partner.

## Using SuperIMAP

First, configure a new partner with a Gmail OAuth 2.0 connection:

1. Create a new partner. Set webhooks to notify your application of the following events:
   * A new email has arrived.
   * A user has connected their email account.
   * A user has disconnected their email account.
2. Create a new IMAP connection under the partner. Get your
   credentials here: https://console.developers.google.com/project;
   read more here:
   https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenIDConnect

Then, test it out by connecting a single user:

1. Create a new user under a partner's IMAP connection.
2. Click the 'Connect' link to connect the user to an IMAP provider.
3. Send yourself email, and watch the logs!

Finally, write code in your app to create and connect users as follows:

```ruby
    require 'rest-client'

    url = "https://my-app.com/api/v1/connections/GMAIL_OAUTH2/users"
    users = RestClient::Resource.new(url, :headers => {
      :'x-api-key'  => "$API_KEY$",
      :content_type => :json,
      :accept       => :json
    })

    # Create the user.
    users.post(:tag => "MY_USER")

    # Get the connect url.
    response = users["MY_USER"].get
    connect_url = JSON.parse(response)['connect_url']

    # Set up the success and failure callbacks.
    callbacks = {
      :success => "http://my-app.com/connect_callback?success=1",
      :failure => "http://my-app.com/connect_callback?failure=1"
    }

    # Redirect the user to the connect url.
    redirect_to connect_url  + "?" + callbacks.to_query
```

```ruby
    url = "https://my-host.com/api/v1/connections/GMAIL_OAUTH2/users"
    users = RestClient::Resource.new(url, :headers => {
      :'x-api-key'  => "$API_KEY$",
      :content_type => :json,
      :accept       => :json
    })

    # Later, if you want to disconnect the user.
    response = users["MY_USER"].get
    disconnect_url = JSON.parse(response)['disconnect_url']

    # Set up the success and failure callbacks.
    callbacks = {
      :success => "http://my-app.com/disconnect_callback?success=1"
    }

    # Redirect the user to the disconnect url.
    redirect_to disconnect_url  + "?" + callbacks.to_query
```

## Webhooks

+ All webhooks are dispatched through delayed jobs.
+ Webhooks will be retried up to 6 times, with exponential backoff.
+ Webhooks will fail if the receiving server takes more than 30 seconds to respond.
+ Webhooks expect a success response (HTTP code 200 - 206).
+ A "Forbidden" response code of 403 will automatically archive the user.
+ Any other response codes count as an error, and will trigger another webhook attempt.

All webhooks are signed. You can validate the signature as follows:

```ruby
    # Parse the incoming JSON body.
    json_params = JSON.parse(request.raw_post)

    # Calculate expected signature.
    digest    = OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256')
    api_key   = Rails.application.config.super_imap_api_key
    sha1      = json_params['sha1']
    timestamp = json_params['timestamp']
    expected_signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(digest, api_key, "#{timestamp}#{sha1}")

    # Get actual signature.
    actual_signature = json_params['signature']

    # Compare signatures.
    valid = expected_signature == actual_signature
```

#### New Mail Webhook

## Running SuperIMAP

#### Architecture

SuperIMAP consists of 3 different processes:

+ 'web' - Serves the admin interface and the API.
+ 'imap_client' - Handles the task of connecting to IMAP providers and listening for email.
+ 'worker' - Processes background jobs generated by the 'imap_client' process.

The IMAP Client process does the heavy lifting. By default, each IMAP
Client is configured to handle 500 users. You can change this, and
other settings, through environment variables.

#### Environment Variables

+ `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - If provided, used to encrypt passwords and secret keys. Required in production.
+ `MAX_USER_THREADS` - Change the maximum number of user threads. Default is 500.
+ `NUM_WORKER_THREADS` - Change the number of worker threads. Default is 5.
+ `MAX_EMAIL_SIZE` - Change the maximum email size. Default is 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes).
+ `TRACER_INTERVAL` - Interval, in seconds, between outgoing tracer emails. Default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
+ `NUM_TRACERS` - Number of tracers to send at the end of each tracer interval. Default is 3.

#### Scaling

To scale SuperIMAP, you will mainly want to increase the number of IMAP
Client processes. The IMAP Client processes automatically publish a
heartbeat every 10 seconds. Other instances look for this heartbeat
and re-calculate which neighboring processes are alive based on any
processes that have published a heartbeat within the last 30 seconds.

The IMAP Client processes re-balance users every 10 seconds. If no new
instances have entered or left the pool, then re-balancing will have
no effect.

If a new IMAP Client instance is started, then a small number of users
will be taken from each running instance and handed to the new
instance. If one of the IMAP Client instances is stopped it is removed
from the pool, then it's users will be evenly distributed to the
remaining instances (assuming they are still below the
`MAX_USER_THREADS` threshold.)

There is no "master" process that decides which IMAP Client process
should handle a given user. SuperIMAP uses a
[Rendezvous Hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing) to
allow IMAP Client instances to agree on how to evenly assign users
without any central coordination. The algorithm assumes that all
SuperIMAP instances have roughly the same number of resources.

#### Operations

SuperIMAP publishes some useful monitoring information in the logs.
This includes:

+ `imap_client.user_thread.count` - The size of the imap client work queue. Backups may indicate that your servers are overloaded.
+ `imap_client.total_emails_processed` - The total number of emails processed since the instance was started.
+ `imap_client.work_queue.length` - The number of user threads. This indicates how many users are connected on a given IMAP Client instance.
+ `work_queue.latency` - The latency, in seconds, between when an item is added to the work queue and when it is processed.

These metrics are published in a format that can be consumed by the
Librato Add-On in Heroku. See
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/librato#custom-log-based-metrics
for more information.

Apart from keeping an eye on these metrics, SuperIMAP should need no other regular metrics.

You may also want to keep an eye out for any failing Delayed Job tasks. You can view these from the Admin site.

#### Performance

SuperIMAP's architecture makes judicious use of system resources:

All connections to the IMAP server are managed by separate "user
threads", but these threads sit dormant most of the time. When
anything interesting happens that requires real work, the operation is
queued and handled by a worker in a worker pool. The size of the
worker pool is controlled by the `NUM_WORKER_THREADS` environment
variable. Only worker pools threads, and a small number of other
system threads, require a database connection.

In terms of tradeoffs, this architecture chooses to slightly degrade
an individual user's response time in favor of making sure that the
system will not get overloaded when things get rough. When things get
busy, the work simply builds up in the queue. The size of the worker
queue, and the queue latency, becomes a rough measure of system
health.

Typically, a SuperIMAP box is resource-limited by the number of user
processes that can be started. SuperIMAP requires 2 user processes for
each user's IMAP connection. On Heroku, the number of user processes
are limited at 256 for a 1X box, 512 for a 2X box, and 32,767 for a PX
box. You can set this at home using `ulimit -u`. Divide this in half
to get the maximum number of users that the SuperIMAP process can
manage.

[FiveStreet.com](https://www.fivestreet.com) uses SuperIMAP to manages
thousands of users and process over 1M incoming emails per week (as of
January 2015). We currently run this load on a single Heroku PX dyno,
with plenty of headroom. Our SuperIMAP instance serving thousands of
users requires just 10 database connections, uses about 3GB of RAM,
and has a 0.50 load average. The work queue usually sits near 0, with
a latency of < 0.5 seconds.

#### Tracer Emails

SuperIMAP has the ability to give you useful monitoring information
through "tracer emails". The system will send a specially formatted
email to an account, wait for the incoming email, and log the
results. The logs can be accessed through the "Tracer Logs" tab.

To enable Tracer Emails, navigate to a user and check the "Enable
Tracer" checkbox. It is recommended that you create a few dummy email
addresses to use for tracer emails.

By default, a cluster of three tracers are sent every ten minutes from
each `imap_client` instance to a random tracer-enabled user managed by
that instance.

Keep in mind that this could generate a lot of email. Three emails
every ten minutes works out to over 432 emails per day.

#### Development Environment

Run this once:

    # Run this once.
    bundle; rake db:setup db:seed

Then start the server:

    foreman s -f Procfile.development

Log in as the default user: "admin@example.com" / "password"

#### Production Environment

Run this once:

    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:setup db:seed

Then start the server:

    foreman s -f Procfile

Log in as the default user: "admin@example.com" / "password", and
**change the username / password immediately!** Please use a very
secure password.

The production Procfile assumes that you are installing on Heroku. As
a result it has multiple definitions for the `imap_client` process
corresponding to different sized Heroku dynos. In order for load
balancing to work correctly, you should have all `imap_client`
processes use the same dyno size. Do not mix and match boxes.

#### Testing

Run this once:

    RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup db:seed

Then run all tests:

    rake test:all

#### Stress Testing

The stress test exercises the multi-threaded aspects of SuperIMAP, as
well as the error recovery code. To do this, we point the SuperIMAP IMAP
client code against a local IMAP server and generate a bunch of fake emails
for many users.

Additionally, the IMAP server generates 'chaotic' events; it will
intentionally generate incorrect or gibberish responses. The SuperIMAP
IMAP client code is expected to recover gracefully while using a
minimal amount of system resources.

Run this once:

    RAILS_ENV=stress rake db:setup db:seed"

Then run the stress test:

    script/stress-test

## Future Work

* Configure stress test to report code coverage.
* Make a way to "sweep" a user's inbox, generating webhook events for all emails.

## Contributions

To contribute to this project, please fork and file a pull
request. Small patches will be accepted more quickly than large
patches.

## API

All API calls are scoped by partner. To authenticate, send the
Partner's API key using a header or a parameter. (A header is
preferred because it won't normally appear in HTTP logs.)

```sh
    # Access the API curl:
    curl -H "Accept: json" \
         -H "x-api-key:APIKEY" \
         https://my-host.com/api/v1/connections
```


```ruby
    # Access the API using the rest-client gem:
    url = "https://my-host.com/api/v1"
    resource = RestClient::Resource.new(url, :headers => {
      :'x-api-key'  => "$API_KEY$",
      :content_type => :json,
      :accept       => :json
    })
    resource['connections'].get
```
